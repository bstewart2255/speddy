Student Information:
- Initials: ${request.studentInitials}
- Grade Level: ${request.gradeLevel}

Target IEP Goal:
"${request.iepGoal}"

Requirements:
1. Create 2-4 problems that directly assess progress toward this IEP goal
2. Problems should be appropriate for grade ${request.gradeLevel}
3. Mix problem types (multiple choice, short answer, or computation)
4. Each problem should be solvable independently in 1-2 minutes
5. Language should be clear and grade-appropriate
6. For multiple choice, provide 3-4 options

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING COMPREHENSION:
- If the IEP goal involves reading comprehension, include a "passage" field with a short text (3-5 sentences)
- The passage should be appropriate for grade ${request.gradeLevel}
- All comprehension questions should reference "the passage above"
- Make the passage interesting and engaging for students

FOR OTHER GOALS:
- Each problem must be completely self-contained with all needed information
- Math word problems must include all numbers and context
- Never reference external materials

Return the response in this exact JSON format:

For reading comprehension goals:
{
  "passage": "A short reading passage here (3-5 sentences for grade ${request.gradeLevel})",
  "problems": [
    {
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "Based on the passage above, what...",
      "options": ["A) Option 1", "B) Option 2", "C) Option 3", "D) Option 4"],
      "answer": "A"
    },
    {
      "type": "short_answer",
      "question": "According to the passage, why did...",
      "answer": "Expected answer"
    }
  ]
}

For other goals (no passage needed):
{
  "problems": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "problem": "Complete self-contained problem with all information",
      "answer": "Solution"
    }
  ]
}

Important:
- Keep problems concise and focused on the IEP goal
- Ensure all problems are solvable with paper and pencil only
- Do not include images or complex diagrams
- Make sure the difficulty is appropriate for independent work
- For reading comprehension, use the "passage" field once, then reference it in questions`;
