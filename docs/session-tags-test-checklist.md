# Session Tags Functionality Test Checklist

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Real-time Updates

- Tags update immediately as you type in the popup input field
- Uses controlled component pattern with `value={sessionTags[session.id] || ''}`
- onChange handler updates state immediately: `setSessionTags(prev => ({...prev, [session.id]: e.target.value}))`

### 2. Tag Persistence During Navigation

- Tags are stored in component state at the page level
- State persists while navigating around the schedule (selecting different days, time slots, grades)
- Tags are ephemeral - they will be lost on page refresh (by design)

### 3. Empty/Whitespace Handling

- Display condition: `sessionTags[session.id]?.trim() &&` ensures empty or whitespace-only tags don't render
- Trimming is applied both for display check and actual display

### 4. Truncation for Long Tags

- Tags longer than 4 characters are truncated with "..." appended
- Example: "meeting" displays as "meet..."
- Prevents tags from breaking the session block layout

### 5. Independent Tags per Session

- Each session has its own tag stored by session ID: `sessionTags[session.id]`
- Multiple sessions can have different tags simultaneously
- Tags are stored in a Record<string, string> structure

## üé® Styling Improvements Applied

- **Background**: Changed from `bg-gray-200` to `bg-gray-100` for subtler appearance
- **Text Color**: Changed from `text-gray-700` to `text-gray-600` for better contrast
- **Font Size**: Changed from `text-xs` to `text-[9px]` to match other session text
- **Font Weight**: Added `font-medium` for better readability
- **Overflow**: Added `max-w-full overflow-hidden` to prevent layout breaks
- **Truncation**: Increased from 3 to 4 characters for better tag visibility

## üìù Testing Instructions

1. **Test Real-time Updates**:
   - Click on a session block to open the popup
   - Type in the Tag field
   - Verify the tag appears immediately on the session block

2. **Test Persistence**:
   - Add tags to multiple sessions
   - Switch between different grade filters
   - Toggle school hours on/off
   - Select different days/time slots
   - Verify tags remain visible

3. **Test Empty Tags**:
   - Enter only spaces in the tag field
   - Clear a tag completely
   - Verify no tag badge appears on the session

4. **Test Truncation**:
   - Enter a short tag (1-4 chars): Should display fully
   - Enter a long tag (5+ chars): Should truncate to 4 chars + "..."

5. **Test Multiple Sessions**:
   - Add different tags to different sessions
   - Verify each maintains its own tag independently
