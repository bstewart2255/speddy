# CA-NDPA (CITE / CSPA) Execution Packet — Speddy

Working packet for executing the **California Student Data Privacy Agreement,
CA-NDPA Standard, Version 1.5 (01.28.25)** via CITE / the California Student
Privacy Alliance. Companion to `data-inventory.md`, `subprocessors.md`,
`offboarding-runbook.md`, and `speddy-technical-security-overview.md`.
Tracked in SPE-59.

> **Not legal advice.** Everything here is drafted from the repo docs and the
> live database schema (project `qkcruccytmmdajfavpgb`, verified 2026-06-12).
> The full packet must be reviewed by FERPA/COPPA counsel before signature —
> items needing attorney/DPO review are marked **[ATTORNEY]** / **[DPO]**.
> Open inputs are marked **[NEEDED]**.

The fillable PDF is 23 pages: cover + preamble (pp. 1–3), Standard Clauses
v3.0 (pp. 4–9), Exhibit A (p. 10), Exhibit B (pp. 11–13), Exhibit C (pp.
14–15), Exhibit D (p. 16), Exhibit E (p. 17), Exhibit F (p. 18), Exhibit G +
AI Addendum (pp. 19–23). There is **no Exhibit H page** in this version even

### Exhibit A — Description of Services (p. 10)

Fields: services description, excluded-services box, completion checkbox.
Draft text in §2 below. Recommend **no exclusions** (the form covers all
current and future services by default, including the Chrome extension).

### Exhibit B — Schedule of Data (pp. 11–13)

Full element-by-element draft in §3 below. Sources: `data-inventory.md`
(verified against live schema 2026-06-12).

### Exhibit C — Definitions (pp. 14–15)

No input required. Note the broad Student Data definition explicitly includes
special education data and metadata.

### Exhibit D — Disposition of Data (p. 16)

**Do not fill at execution** — the form itself says so. Used later when an
LEA issues a disposition directive. Our tooling supports both "destruction"
and (pending SPE-60) "transfer" dispositions — `offboarding-runbook.md`.

### Exhibit E — General Offer of Privacy Terms (p. 17)

| Field | What goes there | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Originating LEA name + DPA date | The first district that signs; filled at execution | — |
| Email where Subscribing LEAs send signed Exhibit E | **help@speddy.xyz** (decided 2026-06-12) | — |
| PROVIDER / BY / Printed Name / Title / Date | Orchestrate LLC + signatory | Decision 2 |
| Subscribing LEA section | Leave blank (future LEAs fill) | — |

### Exhibit F — Data Security Requirements (p. 18)

A list of acceptable frameworks (NIST CSF 1.1, NIST 800-53/800-171, ISO
27000-series, SCF, CIS Controls, CMMC). No blanks, but Art. V §3 makes
"implement an adequate Cybersecurity Framework based on one of" them a
contractual promise → Decision 6.

### Exhibit G — CA Supplemental Terms + AI Addendum (pp. 19–23)

| Field | What goes there | Source |
|---|---|---|
| LEA / Provider names + addresses | Same as cover page | — |
| "Describe how Student Data is Used" | Draft in §4 below | `data-inventory.md`, `subprocessors.md` |
| "Any other information related to Provider's use of AI" | Draft in §4 below (planned/not-enabled disclosure) | `subprocessors.md` (SPE-162/163) |
| Exhibit G signature blocks | Same signatory as cover | — |
| AI Addendum: Type of AI / Purpose / Student Data tables | Leave all unchecked; check **"No AI used at this time"** (Decision 5) | AI hard-gated off — `subprocessors.md` |
| Final "All requested AI Elements…" checkbox | Check after review | — |

Exhibit G obligations to remember when AI is eventually enabled: notice to
LEAs (¶4.1), updated AI Schedule of Data (¶4.2), hallucination-rate
monitoring (¶4.1), bias-audit summaries on request (¶8 amendment), AI
content in student-generated-content ownership (¶2).

## 2. Draft — Exhibit A: Description of Services

> Speddy (speddy.xyz), operated by Orchestrate LLC, is a web-based platform
> for K–12 special-education service providers (resource specialists,
> speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, counselors, and
> special-education assistants) and school/district administrators. The
> Services include: caseload management for students receiving
> special-education services; IEP goal and accommodation tracking; service
> scheduling (sessions, bell schedules, special activities); session
> attendance and service documentation; progress monitoring (assessments,
> exit tickets, progress checks, IEP-goal progress); curriculum tracking;
> creation, storage, and grading of instructional materials and student
> worksheets (including scanned images of student work); student support /
> CARE-team referral and special-education eligibility-process tracking; and
> school staff/scheduling administration. The Services include a companion
> Chrome browser extension that, with the provider's authorization, reads
> student records from the LEA's SEIS (California Special Education
> Information System) account to detect discrepancies between SEIS and
> Speddy records; the extension sends data to Speddy and writes nothing back
> to SEIS. AI-assisted generation features exist in the codebase but are
> disabled platform-wide as of the Effective Date (see Exhibit G).

Excluded services: **none**.

Context the form has no row for (include in the cover note to districts, not
Exhibit B): Speddy also processes **educator/provider PII** (name, email,
role, school; teacher phone/classroom; provider sign-in IP/user agent) —
`data-inventory.md` §B. Exhibit B is student data only.

## 4. Draft — Exhibit G free-text fields

**Describe how Student Data is Used:**

> Student Data is used solely to provide the Services described in Exhibit A:
> scheduling and documenting special-education services; tracking IEP goals,
> accommodations, attendance, and student progress; storing and grading
> student work; and supporting the LEA's special-education referral and
> eligibility workflows. Student Data is not used for targeted advertising or
> profiling, is never sold, and is not used to train AI models. As of the
> Effective Date, no Student Data is processed by any artificial-intelligence
> system: Speddy's AI-assisted features are disabled platform-wide by a
> server-side feature gate, and the associated routes are inoperative.

**Any other information related to Provider's use of AI:**

> Speddy has developed, but has not enabled, optional AI-assisted features
> (lesson, exit-ticket, and progress-check generation; worksheet-image
> grading; document parsing) that would use OpenAI and Anthropic as
> subprocessors. These features are disabled by a platform-level kill switch
> and currently transmit zero data to either provider. Data-processing
> agreements with both providers are executed and on file; both prohibit
> training on customer data. Before enabling any AI feature, Provider will
> (a) apply prompt de-identification, (b) request zero-data-retention
> handling from the AI providers, and (c) provide advance notice to the LEA
> pursuant to Exhibit G § 4.1 and submit an updated AI Schedule of Data
> pursuant to § 4.2.

**AI Addendum tables:** check only **"No AI used at this time"** (with its
built-in commitment to notify the LEA immediately if that changes), then the
final confirmation checkbox. (Decision 5.)

## 5. Draft — Subprocessor disclosure (attachment / on-request)

The CA-NDPA v1.5 has **no subprocessor exhibit**, but Art. II §5 obligates
written agreements with all of them and districts routinely request the list.
Source: `subprocessors.md` (last reviewed 2026-06-11).

| Subprocessor | Function | Student data | Location | Agreement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Supabase | Database, auth, file storage — system of record | Yes — all categories in Exhibit B | US (us-west-1, N. California) | DPA available; **sign via dashboard → Legal Documents [ACTION]** |
| Vercel | Application hosting; traffic + runtime logs | Yes — in transit and incidentally in logs | US-configurable | DPA incorporated into ToS (Pro/Enterprise); **confirm plan tier + save copy [ACTION]** |
| Sentry | Error monitoring, minimized (no logs/replay, PII scrubbed, `sendDefaultPii: false`) | Incidental only | US ingest | DPA self-serve; **accept in Settings → Legal & Compliance [ACTION]** |
| Help Scout | Support help desk + chat widget | No by design (provider PII only) | US | DPA v2 via ToS; DPF + SCCs (SPE-170, on file) |
| OpenAI — **planned, NOT enabled** | AI lesson generation (when enabled) | None today (hard-gated off); initials + IEP goal text when enabled | US | DPA executed 2026-06-12 (SPE-163) |
| Anthropic — **planned, NOT enabled** | AI generation/grading/parsing (when enabled) | None today (hard-gated off) | US | DPA via Commercial Terms, copy on file 2026-06-12 (SPE-163) |

Not subprocessors: **SEIS** (data source the extension reads from, not a
recipient); **Resend** (inbound-email webhook disabled by default; initials
only when active); Supabase Auth transactional email.

## 6. Gaps & decisions (need your input — don't sign without resolving)

1. **[NEEDED] Legal entity details** — exact registered name ("Orchestrate
   LLC"?), state of formation, principal business address. Cover page,
   Exhibit E, Exhibit G.
2. **[NEEDED] Authorized signatory** — name + title for three signature
   blocks (DPA, Exhibit E, Exhibit G).
3. **[NEEDED] Designated representative / security contact** — name, title,
   address, phone (doubles as the Art. V §3 security contact).
   ~~Email-domain conflict~~ **Resolved 2026-06-12: all contact points are
   `help@speddy.xyz`** (privacy page, security overview, IR plan, Exhibit E).
4. **GOPT (Exhibit E)** — sign or not (inbox decided: help@speddy.xyz).
   Recommend signing: it's the CSPA scaling mechanism. Note Exhibit E
   expires 3 years after signature. **[ATTORNEY]**
5. **AI Addendum stance** — recommend "No AI used at this time" + the §4
   planned-use narrative (accurate today; obligates notice + updated AI
   schedule before enabling). Alternative (pre-disclosing AI use now)
   misstates current processing. **[ATTORNEY]**
6. **Cybersecurity framework (Exhibit F / Art. V §3)** — no framework is
   formally adopted today; the security overview describes controls but
   names none. Designate one (NIST CSF 1.1 or CIS Controls fit a team this
   size), write a short internal control mapping, and document variances.
   **[DPO/ATTORNEY]**
7. **Exhibit H doesn't exist in this PDF** — yet Art. V §3 says framework
   variances go in "an attachment to Exhibit H," and Art. VII §3 gives
   Exhibit H top priority. Ask CITE/CSPA how providers attach Exhibit H
   material (or confirm it's intentionally omitted). **[ATTORNEY]**
8. **Subprocessor DPAs (Art. II §5)** — researched 2026-06-12. Three quick
   self-serve actions remain (~15 min total):
   - **Supabase**: DPA must be signed — Supabase dashboard → Organization →
     Legal Documents (PandaDoc flow). Save the executed copy.
   - **Vercel**: DPA is incorporated by reference into the Terms of Service
     (deemed signed) for **Pro/Enterprise** customers — confirm the Speddy
     project is on Pro (Hobby is non-commercial anyway), then save a copy of
     vercel.com/legal/dpa for the records file.
   - **Sentry**: self-serve click-accept — Sentry → Settings → Legal &
     Compliance (requires Owner/Billing role); DocuSign option if a signed
     copy is preferred. Save the acceptance record.
9. ~~Stale security overview~~ **Resolved 2026-06-12** — rewritten (v2.0):
   Vercel hosting, us-west-1 data residency, accurate data inventory (full
   names/DOB disclosed), AI-disabled posture, Help Scout + Chrome extension
   covered, `help@speddy.xyz` contacts, no MFA references.
10. ~~Privacy-page MFA claim~~ **Resolved 2026-06-12** — MFA bullet removed
    from `app/privacy/page.tsx`; page date bumped.
11. ~~Written incident-response plan~~ **Resolved 2026-06-12** — created at
    `docs/incident-response-plan.md` (v1.0): detection, severity levels,
    containment playbook, 72-hour LEA notification with the Art. V §4
    content items, post-incident review, annual tabletop. **[DPO review
    still recommended before distribution.]**
12. ~~Retention cron not scheduled~~ **Resolved 2026-06-12** — `vercel.json`
    created with daily crons for `cleanup-worksheet-images` (12-month image
    TTL) and `cleanup-uploads` (7-day rate-limit rows, 90-day analytics).
    **Verify `CRON_SECRET` is set in the Vercel project env** — Vercel Cron
    sends it as `Authorization: Bearer` automatically; the routes 401
    without it. Confirm first runs in the Vercel dashboard after deploy.
13. **Bulk export (SPE-60) still open** — Art. IV §6 allows disposition by
    *transfer* and districts may request data return. Per-student deletion
    is built; comprehensive export is not. Decide whether to accept the gap
    or prioritize SPE-60 pre-signing.
14. **Exhibit B judgment calls** — Communications unchecked (notes disclosed
    under Other), Observation data unchecked, Program Membership unchecked,
    State ID checked with the extension-cache note. Confirm framings.
    **[ATTORNEY]**
15. **Cover-page state-law blank** — confirm whether the locked PDF
    pre-fills the California statute references; if not, counsel supplies.
    **[ATTORNEY]**
