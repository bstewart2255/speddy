# Schedule Validation Test Scenarios

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Re-enabled Validation in Session Updates

- **File**: `lib/services/session-update-service.ts`
- **Change**: Updated return type to include `conflicts` and `hasConflicts` fields
- **Result**: Validation now runs but allows overrides with warnings

### ✅ 2. Bell Schedule Grade Level Matching

- **File**: `lib/services/session-update-service.ts`
- **Status**: Already correctly implemented (lines 279-293)
- **Behavior**: Properly parses comma-separated grade levels (e.g., "1,2,3")

### ✅ 3. Special Activity Teacher Filtering

- **File**: `lib/services/session-update-service.ts`
- **Status**: Already correctly implemented (lines 302-340)
- **Behavior**: Only checks activities for the student's own teacher

### ✅ 4. UI Warning Dialogs

- **File**: `app/components/weekly-view.tsx`
- **Change**: Added conflict warning dialog with user confirmation
- **Behavior**: Shows specific conflict details and allows override

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Bell Schedule Conflict

1. Find a Grade 4 student's session
2. Drag it to a recess time defined for grades "3,4,5"
3. **Expected**: Warning dialog appears showing bell schedule conflict
4. **User Options**: Can proceed anyway or cancel

### Test 2: Special Activity - Different Teacher (No Conflict)

1. Find a student assigned to Teacher A
2. Drag their session to a time when Teacher B has a special activity
3. **Expected**: No warning, move succeeds immediately

### Test 3: Special Activity - Same Teacher (Conflict)

1. Find a student's session
2. Drag it to their own teacher's special activity time
3. **Expected**: Warning dialog appears showing special activity conflict
4. **User Options**: Can proceed anyway or cancel

### Test 4: Multiple Conflicts

1. Drag a session to a slot with both:
   - Bell schedule conflict (e.g., lunch)
   - Special activity conflict
2. **Expected**: Warning dialog shows BOTH conflicts in the list
3. **User Options**: Can proceed anyway or cancel

### Test 5: Concurrent Session Limit

1. Arrange 6 sessions at the same time
2. Try to drag a 7th session to that time
3. **Expected**: Warning about exceeding concurrent session limit (6)

### Test 6: Consecutive Session Rule (>60 minutes)

1. Place a 30-minute session for a student
2. Drag another 40-minute session for the same student right after it
3. **Expected**: Warning about consecutive sessions exceeding 60 minutes

### Test 7: Break Requirement Violation

1. Place a session for a student
2. Drag another session with only 20-minute gap (less than 30 required)
3. **Expected**: Warning about insufficient break time

## How the System Works Now

1. **Validation Runs**: All validation checks execute when dragging sessions
2. **Conflicts Detected**: System identifies all types of conflicts
3. **User Informed**: Specific conflict details shown in warning dialog
4. **User Choice**: Can override conflicts after confirmation
5. **Rollback Option**: If user cancels, session returns to original position

## Key Improvements

- ✅ Validation no longer silently bypassed
- ✅ Grade-level matching works with comma-separated values
- ✅ Teacher-specific filtering prevents false positives
- ✅ Users get clear feedback about conflicts
- ✅ Manual overrides still possible for flexibility
